# TellIT

Tellit is a semblance to the reddit social network I tried to recreate in this project.

# What I've done

In all this time, I was able to create handling multiple users, customizing them, creating posts, tracking only the users subscribed to and searching through users accordingly.

# Index

Here you can see all the posts of people you are subscribed to, upload your post, like a users post or choose search or drop down menu. But only registered users get to this page (this logic is present in all files except registration and profile login).

# Profile

In the profile we can track the number of subscribers to the posts or users you are subscribed to as well as if it is not your user you can subscribe to the profile.

# Settings

Here you can customize basic features such as bio, birthday, profile photo.

# Input/Input

The basic functionality for logging in and logging out has been implemented in these files.

# For the future

The only error that did not allow me to create this task 100% is Heroku apps for trying to realize hosting with the help of this service failed to pass some of the errors. Although locally everything was working even after transferring the whole project to PostgreSQL.
